# IPL Team Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict the winning team in Indian Premier League (IPL) matches using machine learning models. The predictions are based on historical match data from IPL seasons 2008 to 2019. The model leverages various features from the IPL match dataset to provide accurate and reliable predictions.

## Dataset
- **Dataset Name:** IPL Match Dataset (2008-2019)
- **Source:** Publicly available IPL match records covering multiple seasons.
- **Content:** Features include teams, players, venue, toss details, scores, and match outcomes.

## Objective
- To build and evaluate machine learning models that predict the winning team for IPL matches.
- Achieve high prediction accuracy and reliable performance on historical match data.
- Provide insights into factors influencing match outcomes.

## Technologies and Libraries Used
- Python 3.x
- Pandas: For data loading and preprocessing
- NumPy: Numerical operations
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization
- XGBoost / LightGBM (optional): Gradient boosting models for enhanced performance
- NLTK / TextBlob (optional): For any text-based feature engineering related to commentary or player analysis

## Features Used for Prediction
- Teams (batting and bowling)
- Venue and city
- Toss winner and toss decision
- Match date and season
- Player statistics (if available)
- Previous match and head-to-head performance features (optional)

## Machine Learning Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting Machines (XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Ensemble methods combining multiple classifiers

## Model Performance
- The models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
- Cross-validation was used to ensure robustness.
- Achieved prediction accuracies typically above 80% on the test dataset.
- Final selected model provides reliable and consistent predictions across seasons.
